1. collision & proper hitboxes [x]
2. walls and map loading [x]
3. enemies [x]
4. bullets

enemy shooting:
1. enemy shoots 
2. a packet is sent to the client
3. avg latency is used to determine when the client gets the packet (call this t=x)
4. spawn server sided projectile at t=x
5. client sided projectile should also spawn at t=x cuz thats when they get the packet
6. synced except in cases of lag spikes

collision detection every tick:
1. the server will rewind bullets backward by avg latency 
2. test collision
